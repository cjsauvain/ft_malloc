- check that every alloc and free blocks belong to a single page only
	--> check where the size leads us from the allocated block address : in the next following page or in the same page (in the next page : get a new available block with a different address or allocate a new heap if there is no other avalaible block)

- Reset the heap allocation size to minimiza page faults

- Reminder of what mmap's flags mean

- cut heap_utils_bonus.c into multiple files

- Think about bool reached_end_page added in struct.h, good or bad idea ?
